# Simon-Says
<p>Made a Simon Says game using the MSP430 microcontroller LaunchPad, an accelerometer, and radial LEDs. One player would set a movement pattern by rotating the LaunchPad in 3D space, and a second player would have to replicate the movements to win. The LEDs indicate the position of the LaunchPad and blink to indicate a win or loss.</p>
